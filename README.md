# Just Pug It! Add CodyHouse Framework... written in Pug!
Pug/SCSS project starter with live-reload. No extra CSS frameworks or anything like that are included; just a plain and simple bare-bones project starter because you're a CSS wizard and like to start from scratch. It won't hurt my feelings if you add Bootstrap as a dependency though.

## Getting started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/derekbtw/just-pug-it.git --branch chf "just-pug-it-chf"

$ cd just-pug-it-chf

$ npm install
# or
$ yarn
```
Lastly...
```sh
$ gulp
```

Gulp will now watch for changes in the `views` and `scss` directories with live-reload, yo.

## NPM

Alternatively, you can also install into an existing project from NPM.

```sh
$ npm i just-pug-it
# or
$ yarn add just-pug-it
```
