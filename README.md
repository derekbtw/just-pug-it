# Just Pug It!
Pug/SCSS project starter with live-reload. No extra CSS frameworks or anything like that are included; just a plain and simple bare-bones project starter because you're a CSS wizard and like to start from scratch. It won't hurt my feelings if you add Bootstrap as a dependency though.

## Getting started

```sh
$ npm install

# or

$ yarn
```
Lastly...
```sh
$ gulp
```

Gulp will now watch for changes in the pug and scss directories with live-reload. Woot.

## NPM

Alternatively, you can also install into an existing project from NPM (because why not, yo?).

```sh
$ npm i just-pug-it
```

## To do

- CLI intigration
- Think of some badass features to implement
